# DrawAR
 An app for Android that helps people learn to draw

 Software requirements:
	Unity 6000.2.3f1
	Vuforia Engine 11.4
	Visual Studio 1.103.2
	Android SDK 1.16
	Microsoft .NET SDK 9.0.305

In order to ensure proper functionality of the application, it is necessary to download and import the Vuforia Engine (version 11.4) into the Unity project.

During the initial build process, Unity may require additional time to recompile and reassemble the required libraries. This behavior is expected and should not be interpreted as an error.
